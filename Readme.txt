This package will be a sandbox where I play around with node.js, socket.io and express. 

To get started: 

1) Clone this repository. 

2) Install the node package manager (NPM). 

Install dependencies: 
3) npm install express

4) npm install socket.io

To start server: 
5) npm chat.js

chat.js starts a server on port 3001. 

index.html listens on the socket started by chat.js. :
